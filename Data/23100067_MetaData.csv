2,"For 2001, the number of trailers for Ontario was calculated using the file provided by Ontario in January, 2002"
3,"A break in the series occurs with the release of the 2010 data due to an improvement in the method used to assign vehicle type. At the national level, the main impact of this change was a net increase in the number of vehicles weighing 15 tonnes and more and a net decrease in the number of vehicles weighing from 4.5 tonnes to less than 15 tonnes. The impacts vary considerably by province and territory."
4,"Due to the implantation of a new process from 2013 to 2016 in Prince Edward Island, school buses were included in the total number of buses, whereas they were not included in previous years."
5,"For 1999 and 2000, the number of trailers in Ontario was provided by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation in the annual publication entitled ""Ontario Vehicle Population Statistics""."
6,"Due to a change in British Columbia's regulations in 2015, more off-road vehicles are now registered."
7,"The 2016 estimates for Nunavut were used for the two following years, since the vehicle registration files for these subsequent years were not received at the time of the data release.

."
8,"In 2017, in Prince Edward Island, school buses were shifted from annual renewable registration to a non-expiring registration. This accounts for the decline in the school bus registrations. For more information, please contact the PEI Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy. 

"
9,"A processing error was discovered and subsequently corrected by Prince Edward Island in 2018. As a result, the level of all categories of vehicles have shifted upward in 2018 compared to previous years. For more information, please contact the PEI Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy. "
