4,"“Gross sales of gasoline” represents total sales of all road grades of gasoline, including off-road activities such as farming, forestry, construction and mining."
5,"“Net sales of gasoline” (road grade), “Net sales of diesel oil” (road), and “Net sales of liquefied petroleum gas” represent sales on which taxes were remitted at road-use rates minus sales previously reported at road-use tax rates on which taxes were totally or partially refunded."
6,"Motor vehicle fuel sales data is derived by subtracting the amount of fuel applied for road tax refund from the total amount of fuel sold in each month; application for road tax refund very often is a culmination of several months’ value and likely contains revision for previously submitted applications. These data are solely for the Department of Finance to calculate fiscal equalization payments to the Provinces and territories; they are not intended for direct comparison with other production, consumption or deployment of fuel sales data."
7,"Motor fuel tax applies to propane in all cases unless a specific exemption applies, such as propane: sold in cylinders with a maximum capacity of 28 litres or sealed/pre-packaged containers up to 4 litres, purchased solely for residential use, or if incorporated into tangible personal property. Propane includes liquefied petroleum gas that contains propane. As of April 2013, propane became taxable under the Motor Fuel Tax Act. "
8,"Historical monthly data are available in the archived table 23-10-0080."
